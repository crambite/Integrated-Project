when dragging the text editor too fast and mouse leaves the text editor, the text editor stops moving and when mouse goes back on, the text editor can be dragged wihout clicking
output returns undefined upon using a function, shouldnt be too much of an issue however as the output will be removed in the final draft and is only used for debugging
